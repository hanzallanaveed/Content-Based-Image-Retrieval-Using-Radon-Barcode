- #Project Description

-There are a hundred handwritten images provided, with ten images representing each digit of a
number (0 to 9). The aim is to retrieve a content-based image using a radon barcode. There is a
singular barcode that represents each image, which will then be used to search for other barcodes
that are the most similar to it. Then, through many trials, the accuracy of retrieving a similar
image will then be acquired.
