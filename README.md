# Project Description
 
One hundred handwritten images are provided, with ten images for each digit (0 to 9). The goal is to use a Radon barcode to perform content-based image retrieval. Each image is represented by a unique barcode, which is used to search for other barcodes that are most similar. Through multiple trials, the accuracy of retrieving similar images will be evaluated.
